# Upload-Download-JSON-file
Project built in HTML and JS.
This website allows the user to upload a JSON file and download it with further "objects" created in the website. 

ATTENTION. THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION.
This project was built for manage only generic "Users", so it works only if the uploaded json contains User objects, so that js can 
concatenate all the users together and export a json which contains all the users.
